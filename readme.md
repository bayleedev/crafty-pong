Todo:

 * Models (backbone models?) - events for passing logic is ick!
 * Build a tile based board so this logic doesn't live in the scene
 * Test
 * More framework-y

Framework idea:

 * Grunt to autocompile coffee
 * src and test folders
 * jasmine test runner
 * Encourage putting logic in "board", "components" and "models".
 * Premade classes: Base Compoment, Base Scene, Base Game, Base Model

Upon creation of component class, we should add it to Crafty automatically. Same with scenes.
